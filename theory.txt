*Function Oriented Diagram: Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Structured Chart:*

*Data Flow Diagram (DFD):*
DFD is a graphical representation that illustrates the flow of data within the system. It consists of processes, data stores, data flows, and external entities. Processes depict the transformations applied to data, while data stores represent repositories for data, and data flows indicate the movement of data between components.

*Structured Chart:*
A structured chart is a hierarchical representation of the system's structure, showing the relationships between different modules or components. It provides a visual guide to the organization and hierarchy of various functions within the system.

---

*Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):*

ERD is a visual representation of the data model, illustrating the relationships between entities in a database. Entities represent real-world objects, and relationships depict how these entities are connected. Attributes associated with entities provide additional details about the data.

---

*Userâ€™s View Analysis: Use Case Diagram:*

A use case diagram displays the interactions between users (actors) and the system, showcasing various use cases or scenarios. It helps in understanding the system's functionality from a user's perspective and identifies the relationships between actors and use cases.

---

*Structural View Diagram: Class Diagram, Object Diagram:*

*Class Diagram:*
A class diagram represents the static structure of a system, showcasing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. It serves as a blueprint for the system's architecture, emphasizing the static design elements.

*Object Diagram:*
An object diagram provides a snapshot of instances of classes and their relationships at a specific point in time. It shows how objects collaborate and interact at runtime.

---

*Behavioral View Diagram: State-Chart Diagram, Activity Diagram:*

*State-Chart Diagram:*
A state-chart diagram illustrates the various states a system or object can be in and the transitions between these states. It is particularly useful for modeling the behavior of dynamic systems over time.

*Activity Diagram:*
An activity diagram visualizes the flow of activities within a system, representing the sequential and parallel activities involved in a process. It is effective for modeling business processes and workflows.

---

*Behavioral View Diagram for the Suggested System: Sequence Diagram, Collaboration Diagram:*

*Sequence Diagram:*
A sequence diagram depicts the interactions between objects in a chronological sequence. It shows the flow of messages and the order of events, providing insights into the dynamic behavior of the system.

*Collaboration Diagram:*
A collaboration diagram, also known as a communication diagram, visualizes the interactions and relationships between objects in a system. It emphasizes the connections and collaborations among objects during runtime.

---

*Implementation View Diagram: Component Diagram:*

A component diagram illustrates the organization and dependencies of software components in a system. It showcases the high-level architecture, emphasizing the relationships between components and their interactions.

*Theory on Keywords:*

- *Processes (DFD):* Represent activities or functions within the system that manipulate data.

- *Entities (ERD):* Objects or concepts in the system that can be uniquely identified and have attributes.

- *Use Case (Use Case Diagram):* A specific functionality or interaction between a user (actor) and the system.

- *Classes (Class Diagram):* Blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and behavior.

- *States (State-Chart Diagram):* Different conditions or modes that an object or system can be in.

- *Activities (Activity Diagram):* Represent tasks or actions within a process or workflow.

- *Messages (Sequence Diagram):* Communication between objects in a specific sequence.

- *Components (Component Diagram):* Modular units or building blocks of a system.

Each of these diagrams and concepts plays a crucial role in understanding and designing different aspects of the suggested system, contributing to a holistic development approach.
